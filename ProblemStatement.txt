Problem Statement 

When does the problem arise?
-> QR Codes may be troublesome to scan when in harsh lighting
-> Users may not want to share their phone numbers for money transfer
	
Who does this affect?
-> People who use contactless payment regularly
-> Users who care about their personal information being made publicly available

Current Solutions
-> PayNow (using NRIC, UEN, etc)
-> Not as seamless as we want it to be for close contact payment transfers & arguably still not as secure and private as we want it to be


Aims & Objectives
-> To build a dependable contactless payment system that completes transfers securely, while requiring the lowest amount of user interaction possible
	dependable -> not affected by harsh lighting, or mistyping phone numbers, etc
	securely -> users address is useless after the first 5 minutes unlike NRIC, phone number, etc which is permanent
	lowest amount of user interaction -> just stand near the person you want to transfer to to complete a transfer
